DOES NOT WORK

- It would be nice to include the reference, books, etc als external input files. Did not find a simple
include{} operation -->
- did try to get this going https://www.w3schools.com/w3js/w3js_html_include.asp
1. get w3.js and add to assets
2. add this to page
<script src="assets/js/w3.js"></script>

<script>
    w3.includeHTML();
</script>

But hten i get the following: this sounds too complicated

2022 in Doyne Farmer, Til Schuermann, Alissa Kleinnijenhuis, and Thom Wetzer editors (2022), <i> Handbook of Financial
    Stress Testing</i>, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press<p style="text-align:justify">The 2008-2010 crisis has
    shown that authorities were missing crucial information for accurately identifying risks in the financial system. In
    response, more and more granular data is being collected. What can we actually do with this? <span id="more-cup2022"
        style="display:none;">This realization has led to a significant increase in the depth and scope of information
        being reported across the system. At the same time, the cost of reporting has gone down due to further
        digitization.<br> In this paper we will examine how increased granularity allows authorities to put the data to
        better use and we will focus in particular on stress testing. Stress testing involves postulating severe
        scenario’s that often have yet to materialize. More granular data combined flexibly from different sources allow
        for more accurate assessment of such adverse hypothetical states of the world. For instance, detailed
        information on inter-bank exposures allows for understanding bank to bank contagion much better. <br> We will
        briefly discuss the developments in the last decade and discuss what possibilities arise. The new granular data
        sets allow us to implement stress tests on various levels of aggregations using the very same data sets. Then we
        will turn to prerequisites in terms of for instance meta data allowing to connect data sets and data governance
        specifying how to treat the data. Finally, we will discuss remaining challenges, ranging from data quality up to
        high performance IT infrastructure and a company culture that embraces data. (<a href=""

<h3 class="mb-0" id="risk2015">Liquidity Risk Management and Supervision: A Guide to Better Practice</h3>Edited jointly
with Clemens Bonner and Paul Hilbers in 2015 in Risk Books (2015)<p style="text-align:justify">Eventually, liquidity
    problems are at the core of risk management headaches, both from a micro- as well as from a macro-prudential view.
    <span id="more-risk2015" style="display:none;">In response to the financial crisis, the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and
        Net Stable Funding Ratio have been introduced. While this was an important step for supervision, there is wide
        agreement that compliance with these minimum requirements is not sufficient to ensure sound liquidity risk
        management. Recognising this, both the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the European Banking Authority are
        currently in the process of developing guidance to banks and regulators on how to ensure strong liquidity risk
        management frameworks. Since the in-depth and bank-specific supervision of liquidity risk is a very new topic,
        many banks and regulators will have to make major efforts to prepare for raised expectations and upcoming
        requirements. (<a
